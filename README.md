# React Interview Questions

### **1. React Basics**

1. **What is React?**
   - **Answer**: React is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications. It allows developers to create large web applications that can change data without reloading the page.

2. **What are the main features of React?**
   - **Answer**: The main features of React include:
     - Virtual DOM for efficient rendering
     - Component-based architecture
     - One-way data binding
     - JSX syntax for writing HTML-like code in JavaScript
     - Lifecycle methods for managing component behavior

3. **What is JSX?**
   - **Answer**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within JavaScript. It makes it easier to create React components and describe the UI structure.

4. **What are components in React?**
   - **Answer**: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They are reusable pieces of code that represent a part of the UI, which can be either functional or class-based.

5. **What is the difference between functional and class components?**
   - **Answer**: Functional components are simpler, written as functions, and can use hooks for state and lifecycle methods. Class components are ES6 classes that can hold state and lifecycle methods but are more complex.

6. **What is state in React?**
   - **Answer**: State is an object that holds dynamic data for a component. It can change over time, usually in response to user actions, and when state changes, the component re-renders.

7. **What is props in React?**
   - **Answer**: Props (short for properties) are used to pass data from one component to another, allowing components to be dynamic and reusable. Props are read-only and cannot be modified by the child component.

8. **What are lifecycle methods in React?**
   - **Answer**: Lifecycle methods are special methods in class components that are invoked at different stages of a component’s life, such as mounting, updating, and unmounting. Common lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

9. **What is the Virtual DOM?**
   - **Answer**: The Virtual DOM is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize updates by determining which parts of the actual DOM need to be changed when the state of a component changes.

10. **How do you create a new React application?**
    - **Answer**: You can create a new React application using Create React App by running the command `npx create-react-app my-app`, which sets up a new project with a default configuration.

### **2. React Component Types**

11. **What is the purpose of the render method in React?**
    - **Answer**: The render method in a class component returns the JSX that defines what the UI should look like. It is called whenever the component's state or props change.

12. **How can you handle events in React?**
    - **Answer**: You can handle events in React by adding event listeners to elements in JSX, using camelCase syntax. For example, `<button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>`.

13. **What are controlled components?**
    - **Answer**: Controlled components are form elements whose value is controlled by React state. This means that the component’s state is the single source of truth, and the UI reflects the current state.

14. **What are uncontrolled components?**
    - **Answer**: Uncontrolled components are form elements that manage their own state internally without relying on React. You can access their values using refs instead of state.

15. **What is the purpose of keys in React?**
    - **Answer**: Keys are unique identifiers used in lists to help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed. They optimize rendering performance and prevent unnecessary re-renders.

16. **How do you conditionally render components in React?**
    - **Answer**: You can conditionally render components using JavaScript logical operators (like `&&`) or ternary operators inside JSX. For example: `{isLoggedIn ? <LogoutButton /> : <LoginButton />}`.

17. **What is the purpose of `setState` in React?**
    - **Answer**: `setState` is a method used to update the state of a component. It schedules a re-render and allows React to manage component updates efficiently.

18. **What is the difference between `props` and `state`?**
    - **Answer**: `Props` are used to pass data from parent to child components and are read-only, while `state` is local to a component and can be changed internally, influencing how the component renders.

19. **What are fragments in React?**
    - **Answer**: Fragments are a way to group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They can be created using `<React.Fragment>` or the shorthand `<>`.

20. **What is the purpose of `defaultProps` in React?**
    - **Answer**: `defaultProps` allows you to set default values for props in a component, ensuring that props have a defined value even if not provided by the parent.

### **3. React Hooks**

21. **What are hooks in React?**
    - **Answer**: Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components, promoting a cleaner and more reusable code structure.

22. **What is the `useState` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useState` hook is a built-in React hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array containing the current state value and a function to update it.

23. **How do you use the `useEffect` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useEffect` hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It takes a function as an argument, which runs after the component renders, and can also return a cleanup function.

24. **What is the purpose of the `useContext` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useContext` hook allows you to access the context value directly in a functional component, making it easier to consume context without needing to use a Consumer component.

25. **How do you create custom hooks in React?**
    - **Answer**: You can create custom hooks by defining a function that starts with `use` and uses built-in hooks inside it. This allows you to encapsulate logic and reuse it across components.

26. **What is the `useReducer` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useReducer` hook is a built-in hook that allows you to manage complex state logic in functional components using a reducer function, similar to how Redux manages state.

27. **How can you optimize performance using the `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks?**
    - **Answer**: The `useMemo` hook memoizes expensive calculations, preventing unnecessary recalculations on re-renders, while the `useCallback` hook memoizes functions to prevent them from being recreated on each render.

28. **What is the `useRef` hook used for?**
    - **Answer**: The `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable ref object that persists for the lifetime of the component. It can be used to access DOM elements or to store mutable values without causing re-renders.

29. **What are the rules of hooks?**
    - **Answer**: The rules of hooks are:
      1. Only call hooks at the top level (not inside loops or conditions).
      2. Only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks.

30. **What is the `useLayoutEffect` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useLayoutEffect` hook is similar to `useEffect`, but it runs synchronously after all DOM mutations. It’s useful for reading layout and synchronously re-rendering.

### **4. Routing and Navigation**

31. **What is React Router?**
    - **Answer**: React Router is a library for routing in React applications, allowing you to create single-page applications with navigation between different views without refreshing the page.

32. **What are the main components of React Router?**
    - **Answer**: The main components of React Router include:
      - `<BrowserRouter>`: wraps the application for routing.
      - `<Route>`: defines a route and the component to render.
      - `<Link>`: creates navigation links between routes.
      - `<Switch>`: renders the first `<Route>` that matches the current location.

33. **How do you implement nested routes in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: Nested routes can be implemented by placing a `<Route>` inside the component of another route. This allows rendering child components based on the parent route.

34. **What is the purpose of the `Redirect` component in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: The `Redirect` component is used to programmatically redirect users to a different route when a certain condition is met.

35. **How do you pass parameters to routes in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: You can pass parameters using the `:paramName` syntax in the route path. Access the parameters using the `useParams` hook.

36. **What is a 404 page, and how can you implement it in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: A 404 page indicates that a requested page was not found. You can implement it by adding a `<Route>` with a wildcard path (`*`) at

 the end of your route definitions.

37. **What is `history` in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: The `history` object allows you to manage session history in the browser. It enables navigation, programmatic redirection, and tracking of the user's session history.

38. **How do you handle route protection in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: Route protection can be implemented by creating a higher-order component (HOC) or a custom hook that checks authentication status before rendering the route component.

39. **What is the difference between `HashRouter` and `BrowserRouter`?**
    - **Answer**: `HashRouter` uses the hash portion of the URL to manage routes, which works well for static files, while `BrowserRouter` uses the HTML5 history API, providing cleaner URLs but requiring server configuration for proper routing.

40. **How can you programmatically navigate in React Router?**
    - **Answer**: You can programmatically navigate using the `useHistory` hook, which provides access to the `history` instance. Call `history.push('/path')` to navigate to a different route.

### **5. State Management**

41. **What is state management in React?**
    - **Answer**: State management in React refers to the techniques and libraries used to manage and share state across components in a React application, especially for larger applications.

42. **What are some popular state management libraries for React?**
    - **Answer**: Popular state management libraries include Redux, MobX, Recoil, and Zustand. Each library has its own philosophy and approach to managing state.

43. **What is Redux?**
    - **Answer**: Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications, allowing for a predictable state container. It uses a unidirectional data flow and is commonly used with React.

44. **What is the purpose of the Redux store?**
    - **Answer**: The Redux store holds the application's state, providing methods to access state, dispatch actions, and subscribe to changes in state.

45. **What are actions in Redux?**
    - **Answer**: Actions are plain JavaScript objects that describe changes in the state. Each action has a `type` and can include additional data in the payload.

46. **What are reducers in Redux?**
    - **Answer**: Reducers are pure functions that take the current state and an action as arguments and return a new state based on the action type. They are responsible for updating the Redux store.

47. **What is middleware in Redux?**
    - **Answer**: Middleware in Redux allows you to extend the store's capabilities, enabling you to intercept and modify actions before they reach the reducer. Popular middleware includes Redux Thunk and Redux Saga.

48. **What is the purpose of the `Provider` component in Redux?**
    - **Answer**: The `Provider` component makes the Redux store available to all nested components in the application, allowing them to connect to the store and access the state.

49. **How do you connect a React component to the Redux store?**
    - **Answer**: You can connect a component to the Redux store using the `connect` function from `react-redux`, or by using the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks in functional components.

50. **What is the purpose of the `useSelector` and `useDispatch` hooks in Redux?**
    - **Answer**: The `useSelector` hook allows you to access state from the Redux store, while the `useDispatch` hook provides a way to dispatch actions to the store.

### **6. Advanced React Concepts**

51. **What is context in React?**
    - **Answer**: Context is a way to share values (like state) across the component tree without passing props explicitly at every level. It is useful for managing global data such as themes or user authentication.

52. **How do you create a context in React?**
    - **Answer**: You create a context using `React.createContext()`, which returns a Provider and a Consumer. The Provider is used to supply the context value, and the Consumer accesses the value.

53. **What is the purpose of the `React.memo` function?**
    - **Answer**: `React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes functional components, preventing unnecessary re-renders when the props have not changed.

54. **What is the purpose of the `useCallback` hook?**
    - **Answer**: The `useCallback` hook memoizes a function, returning the same instance of the function unless its dependencies change. This is useful for optimizing performance in child components.

55. **What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**
    - **Answer**: HOCs are functions that take a component as an argument and return a new component. They are used for reusing component logic, such as authentication or data fetching.

56. **What is the difference between a controlled and uncontrolled component?**
    - **Answer**: Controlled components have their form data managed by React state, while uncontrolled components manage their own internal state. Controlled components provide better control and validation.

57. **What is PropTypes in React?**
    - **Answer**: PropTypes is a library that allows you to specify the types of props a component should receive. It helps in type-checking and ensuring that components are used correctly.

58. **How do you optimize performance in React applications?**
    - **Answer**: Performance can be optimized by using the Virtual DOM, memoizing components with `React.memo`, using `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks, implementing lazy loading, and minimizing unnecessary re-renders.

59. **What are error boundaries in React?**

    - **Answer**: Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation, while integration testing checks how different components or systems work together.

63. **How do you mock functions in Jest?**
    - **Answer**: You can mock functions in Jest using `jest.fn()` to create a mock function or `jest.mock('module')` to mock an entire module.

64. **What is a snapshot test in React?**
    - **Answer**: A snapshot test is a way to test the rendered output of a component by saving the output as a reference snapshot and comparing future renders against it.

65. **How do you test hooks in React?**
    - **Answer**: You can test hooks by creating a custom test component that uses the hook and rendering it in your tests using the `render` method from React Testing Library.

66. **What is the purpose of the `act` function in testing?**
    - **Answer**: The `act` function is used in testing to ensure that all updates related to a component's state and effects have been processed before making assertions.

67. **What is the `cleanup` function in React Testing Library?**
    - **Answer**: The `cleanup` function is used to unmount and clean up the rendered components after each test, preventing side effects from interfering with subsequent tests.

68. **How can you test asynchronous code in Jest?**
    - **Answer**: You can test asynchronous code in Jest by using `async/await` syntax, returning a promise, or using the `done` callback in your test functions.

69. **What is end-to-end (E2E) testing?**
    - **Answer**: End-to-end testing involves testing the complete flow of an application from the user's perspective, ensuring that all components work together as expected. Tools like Cypress or Selenium are commonly used for E2E testing.

70. **What is mocking in testing?**
    - **Answer**: Mocking is the process of creating simulated versions of functions or components to isolate tests and control the behavior of dependencies, making tests more reliable and faster.

    - **Answer**: Common performance optimization techniques include using React.memo, lazy loading components, optimizing renders with shouldComponentUpdate, and using the useMemo and useCallback hooks effectively.

121. **What are React portals, and when would you use them?**

   - **Answer**: React portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the parent component. This is useful in scenarios where you want to manage UI elements that need to break out of the normal DOM flow, such as modals, tooltips, or dropdowns, which might be rendered in a different part of the DOM for styling or accessibility purposes. You can create a portal using `ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container)`, where `child` is the React element you want to render, and `container` is the DOM node you want to render it into. This way, the portal maintains the React component's lifecycle and provides seamless integration with the rest of your application while controlling its position in the DOM.

### **8. Working with APIs (Continued)**

122. **What is GraphQL, and how does it differ from REST?**
   - **Answer**: GraphQL is a query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need, minimizing over-fetching or under-fetching. REST has fixed endpoints, whereas GraphQL provides a single endpoint where clients can define the structure of the response.

123. **How can you handle loading states for API calls in React?**
   - **Answer**: You can use a loading state variable, typically initialized to `false`. When an API call starts, set it to `true` and show a loading indicator; reset it to `false` once the data is fetched.

124. **What are `try...catch` blocks, and how do you use them with async calls?**
   - **Answer**: `try...catch` blocks handle errors in JavaScript. In async calls, wrap the `await` code inside a `try` block to catch errors in the `catch` block.

125. **How would you implement infinite scrolling in React?**
   - **Answer**: Use an event listener to detect when the user reaches the bottom of the page, then load more data by making an API call and appending it to the existing data set.

126. **What is an API key, and how should you handle it in React?**
   - **Answer**: An API key is a unique identifier for accessing an API. To handle it securely, store the key in environment variables and avoid exposing it on the client side.

Here are questions 189–200 to complete your list:

189. **What is the purpose of `React.lazy()`?**  
   `React.lazy()` is a function that allows components to be loaded lazily, meaning they're only loaded when they’re rendered. This helps in splitting the bundle and improving application performance by loading components on demand.

190. **How does the `React.Suspense` component work?**  
   `React.Suspense` is a component that wraps around components with lazy loading, allowing React to wait until the component is fully loaded. You can define a fallback (like a loading spinner) to show while the component is being loaded.

191. **What is server-side rendering (SSR) in React?**  
   Server-side rendering is the process of rendering React components on the server, which sends HTML to the client. It improves performance and SEO by allowing search engines to index content more effectively.

192. **What is hydration in the context of React?**  
   Hydration is the process where React “hydrates” the server-rendered HTML with JavaScript, making it interactive. It’s commonly used in SSR to convert static HTML into a fully functional React app.

193. **What are some popular libraries used for server-side rendering with React?**  
   Popular libraries for SSR with React include Next.js and Razzle. They provide built-in support for SSR and offer features like static generation and incremental static regeneration.

194. **How can you manage API calls more efficiently in a React app?**  
   API calls can be managed efficiently by using hooks like `useEffect` for lifecycle control, libraries like Axios or Fetch for HTTP requests, caching responses, and using libraries like React Query to handle data fetching and caching.

195. **What is React Query, and how is it used?**  
   React Query is a library that simplifies data fetching, caching, and synchronization in React applications. It provides hooks to fetch, cache, and update data, managing API calls efficiently and reducing the need for complex state management.

196. **What are error boundaries, and how do they work?**  
   Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI. They prevent the whole app from crashing, offering a user-friendly error-handling mechanism.

197. **How would you implement error boundaries in React?**  
   To implement error boundaries, create a class component with the `componentDidCatch` and `getDerivedStateFromError` lifecycle methods, which update the state to show a fallback UI when an error occurs.

198. **What is code splitting, and why is it important?**  
   Code splitting is a technique for splitting large bundles into smaller, more manageable pieces that are loaded on demand. It improves load times and performance, especially for large applications, by only loading the code required for the current view.

199. **How does Webpack support code splitting in React applications?**  
   Webpack can split code automatically when using `import()` for dynamic imports. It creates separate bundles for imported components, ensuring that only necessary code is loaded, which optimizes load times.

200. **What is the purpose of the React Profiler?**  
   The React Profiler is a tool to measure the performance of components in React applications. It records each render and re-render, showing how much time each component takes, helping developers identify performance bottlenecks and optimize their applications.
